# Fireside Chat üèï

This application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, express, React.js and Node.js) and socket.io for the web socket.

## What is it?

FiresideChat is a chat application designed to match people who want to talk and people who want to listen.

The theme of this website is that of a chat by the fire between a camp counselor and a camper. I believe anonymous expression of ones thoughts can be extremely helpful in imporving mental health.

Many people don't have a 'camp counselor' to chat with and just getting your thoughts out of your head is sometimes effective in helping you organise them.
